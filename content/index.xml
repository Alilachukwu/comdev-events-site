      <description>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) runs, or participates in some fashion in, a number of different types of events, which different target audiences and goals, to educate about our projects and about the Foundation, and to build the communities.
The main types of event we work with around Apache projects are:
 ApacheCon - the ASF&amp;rsquo;s official conference Roadshows - bringing Apache content around the world Endorsed events - run by third parties using Apache brands  If you want to organize your own event that uses Apache brands or trademarks in any way, we strongly encourage you to coordinate with us.</description>

      <title>About Apache Roadshows</title>
      <link>https://events.apache.org/about/roadshow.html</link>

      <guid>https://events.apache.org/about/roadshow.html</guid>
      <description>Apache Roadshows are small regional one- or two-day events, intended to build local community and educate about what the Apache Software Foundation does.
While not a traditional roadshow (ie, a traveling event with multiple stops), we use the name to indicate that there may be multiple small events on a particular continent. Thus, the Europe Roadshow may have small events in Berlin and Barcelona during the course of a year, while the North America Roadshow might have events in DC and Chicago.</description>

      <description>ApacheCon is the official conference of the Apache Software Foundation. Its primary goals are education and community building. We try to produce one each calendar year somewhere in North America and Europe, and are working on expanding this to the rest of the world.
If you want to volunteer to help with ApacheCon, please join our mailing lists, and see what volunteer opportunities we have, bearing in mind that it sometimes gets out of date.</description>

If you are an Apache Committer, and you&amp;rsquo;re interested in putting on an Apache Event, please see the Organising Events section for more help. If you are interested in helping others out with putting on an Apache Event, you are advised to join the appropriate mailing list, and volunteer for events there.</description>
